# Python Server-Client Communication

This project demonstrates a basic server-client communication setup using Python sockets. It includes a server script and a client script that can be used to establish a connection and exchange messages between them.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-directory`

### Server

1. Open the `server.py` file in a text editor.
2. Replace `"SERVER_IP"` and `"SERVER_PORT"` in the script with the appropriate values.
3. Save the file.
4. Run the server script: `python server.py`

### Client

1. Open the `client.py` file in a text editor.
2. Replace `"SERVER_IP"` and `"SERVER_PORT"` in the script with the appropriate values matching the server.
3. Save the file.
4. Run the client script: `python client.py`

## Usage

Once the server and client are running, the client can send messages to the server, and the server will respond back with a confirmation message. The messages are exchanged over the network using sockets.
